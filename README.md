# Notivo — Sign up (React + Tailwind)

Pixel-perfect Sign up page built with React, TypeScript, Vite and Tailwind CSS.

## Quick start
```bash
# 1) Extract and install
npm install

# 2) Start dev server
npm run dev
```

## What’s included
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS configured (Inter font)
- Accessible form controls and buttons
- Marketing preview panel to match the Figma

## File map
- `src/components/SignUpPage.tsx` — the full page component
- `src/styles.css` — Tailwind directives + tiny component classes
- `tailwind.config.js` — color tokens + font

## Notes
- Replace icons or add real auth handlers where needed.
- The right-hand "app preview" is a semantic mock to reduce asset dependencies while matching the Figma visually.
